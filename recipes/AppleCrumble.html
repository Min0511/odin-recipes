    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This apple crumble recipe is the perfect way to welcome fall. Full of cozy autumnal flavors like cinnamon and nutmeg, you'll want to make this apple crumble all season long.</p>
    <H2>ingredients</H2>
    <ul>
        <li>Apples: Granny Smith apples are ideal for this recipe, as they are quite flavorful and tend to hold their shape during the baking process.
        </li>
        <li>Lemon juice: Sprinkle a mixture of lemon juice and water over the apples to prevent browning.
        </li>
        <li>Sugar: A cup of white sugar sweetens things up, perfectly balancing the tart flavor from the Granny Smith apples.
        </li>
        <li>Flour: You'll need all-purpose flour for the "crumbly" part of this apple crumble recipe!
        </li>
        <li>Spices: This cozy dessert is spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg. A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make it taste salty.
        </li>
        <li>Butter: Unsalted butter adds richness and flavor to the topping. Make sure the butter is cold (otherwise, the sugary topping will spread).
        </li>
    </ul>
